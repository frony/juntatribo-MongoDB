# JuntaTribo

This is a personal projet that started as a private jukebox where I can upload music and create playlists that I can share. It will evolve to an app I can use not only as the jukebox but also as a concert finder by bands and geolocations as well as a concert tracker, where I can add notes, pictures and videos of concerts I attend and share it with friends.
